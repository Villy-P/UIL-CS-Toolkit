## What is a base?

Number bases are different ways we can represent numbers.
In our everyday life, we use base `10` to represent numbers, like in our math classes or in conversation.
A base can be written using a subscript after the number, for example `1110101₂` or `10,968₁₀`.
Computers use base `2`, otherwise known as binary for representing their data.
Other important bases to know are bases `8`, `10`, and `16`.
