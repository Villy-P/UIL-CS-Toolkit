  - [Final classes](#final-classes)

## Definitions

* Overriding - When a child class defines the same function as the parent class, with the exact same name as the parent function and the exact same parameters. When the function is called from an object definining the child class, the child function will be called
* Overloading - When a class defines a function with the same name and different parameters. A child class may also overload a function, defining the same function as the parent but with different parameters.

## Abstract Classes

Abstract classes (defined as `abstract class Dog`) **cannot** be instatiated:

``` java
abstract class Element { /* implementation */ }

Element e = new Element(); // error! cannot instatiate abstract class
```

Abstract classes can define abstract functions, which have the signature but no body.
Any non-abstract class that extends the abstract class **must** provide the code for any abstract methods.

Unlike interyou can also create non-abstract methods within an abstract class, .

## Final classes

If a class has `final` added to it, then the class cannot be extended by other classes:

``` java
final class Element { /* implementation */ }

class HTMLElement extends Element { /* implementation */ } // error! can't extend from a final class.
```
