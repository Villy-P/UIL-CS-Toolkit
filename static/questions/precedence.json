            "question": "What is the output by the code below? \n ```java\nout.println((-17 % 7) | (11 << 3));\n```",
            "answers": [
                "`91`",
                "`-3`",
                "`88`",
                "`-91`",
                "There is no output due to a compile error"
            ],
            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "The code will first evaluate the expression `(-17 % 7)`. The remainder of `-17 / 7` is -3, so the result of this expression is `-3`. The code will then evaluate the expression `(11 << 3)`. `11` in binary is `1011`, and shifted `3` over turns it into `1011000`, which is `88`. The code will then evaluate the expression `-3 | 88`. The result of this expression is `-3`. The output will be `-3`.",
