            "answers": [
                "`2`",

                "`8`",
                "`8.0`",
                "There is no output due to a runtime error."
            ],
            "correct": 1,
            "explanation": "`7 / 3` is about `2.33333`, floored is `2`, which is stored into `num1`. `2` cubed is `8`, which is stored in `num2`. `2` < `8`, so `Math.min()` will return `2`, however, since one of the arguments is a `double` (`num2`), the function will return a `double`, so the answer is `2`.",
