            "explanation": "First off, since `s2` has no `E`'s, as it was converted to lowercase, `split` will return an array with size `1`. When `s1` is split by `E`'s, it splits the string into this array: `[\"h\", \"llo th\", \"re... G\", \"n\", \"ral K\", \"nobi\"]`, which has a length of `6`. `6 - 1 = 5`, so our answer is `5`.",
