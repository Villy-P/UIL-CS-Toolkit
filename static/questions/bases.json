            "explanation": "Convert each value to base 10 and add them together. 1100011₂ in base 10 is 99. 10011101₂ in base 10 is 157. 99 + 157 = 256₁₀. Converted to base 8 that is 400₈. Converted to base 16 that is 100₁₆. Converted to base 2 that is 100000000₂. Since all values are equivalent, the answer is `All are`.",
